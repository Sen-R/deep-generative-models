# Deep generative models

## Introduction

This repo contains deep generative model implementations and experiments that I have tried out while reading the following lecture notes and papers:

* Stanford's [CS236](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/) course on deep generative models
* Gan, Z., Henao, R., Carlson, D., Carin, L.  *Learning Deep Sigmoid Belief Networks with Data Augmentation.* JMLR, 2015.

## Getting started

Notebooks were created and run on Google Colab. However, you should be able to run them locally after setting up a python / conda environment with tensorflow installed.
